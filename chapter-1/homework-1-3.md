# Homework 1-3: Encrypt a USB Disk

Here are some options for disk encryption software for encrypting USB disks:

- [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview): Built-in disk encryption for Windows that allows you to encrypt USB disks with a password.
- [Disk Utility](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/welcome/mac): macOS software that allows you to create encrypted USB disks for Macs.
- [GNOME Disks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Disks): Linux software that allows you to create encrypted USB disks for Linux.
- [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr/): Cross-platform disk encryption software. This is a good choice if you will use your USB disk in different operating systems, or if you're using a version of Windows that doesn't come with BitLocker.
