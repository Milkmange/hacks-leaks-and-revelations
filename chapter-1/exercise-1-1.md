# Exercise 1-1: Start Using a Password Manager

There are several good password manager options, and if you already know of one you like then by all means use that instead. Here are the two that I recommend:

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): Free and open source. Works on computers, smartphones, and in browsers, and syncs your encrypted password database to the cloud.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/): Proprietary, but [free for journalists](https://1password.com/for-journalism/). Works on computers, smartphones, and in browsers, and syncs your encrypted password database to the cloud.
- [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/): Free and open source. Works on computers, and keeps your encrypted password database in a local file.
