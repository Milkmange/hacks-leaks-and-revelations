# Homework 2-2: Installing and Using Signal

Try out Signal! First install it on your phone:

- [Signal for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669)
- [Signal for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)

Then install [Signal Desktop](https://signal.org/download/) and link it to your phone.

Get your friends to install Signal too so you can practice using encrypted text messages, texting groups, voice, and video calls.
