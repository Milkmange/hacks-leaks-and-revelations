# Exercise 2-1: Download BlueLeaks

To download BlueLeaks, you'll need a BitTorrent client. I like [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com).

You should read up on the BlueLeaks dataset on DDoSecret's website: https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/BlueLeaks

The BitTorrent magnet link for BlueLeaks is: 

```
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8cf92b7cd3f022fa5478b84963e89c1dd0af090f&dn=BlueLeaks&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.to%3A2920%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce
```

Make sure to download it to a disk that has considerably more than 270 gigabytes of free space.
