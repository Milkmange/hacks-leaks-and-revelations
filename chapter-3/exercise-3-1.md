# Exercise 3-1 for Windows Users: Install Ubuntu in Windows

Check out [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

To install it, open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

When it's done, reboot your computer.

After rebooting, an Ubuntu window will open and you'll need to create a new username and password. Save the password in your password manager.
