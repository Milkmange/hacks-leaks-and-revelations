# Homework 7-1: Install Python

In Windows, download the latest version of Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org). While you’re installing it, make sure to check the box"“Add Python 3.10 to PATH" (or, whatever version of Python 3 you’re installing).

In Linux or Windows with WSL:

```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

In macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install python3
```

When you're done, you should have the commands `python3` and `pip3`.
