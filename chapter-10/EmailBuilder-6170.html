        style="font-family: Calibri, Times; orphans: 1;">To assist with coordination of information between the NCRIC
        and local,
        State and Federal Law Enforcement agencies, we will be providing a list of
        local protests twice daily at 1000 and 1800, until further notice. This
        information is for Situational Awareness only. Agencies may use this
        information for planning/staffing purposes or as they see fit. Further
        dissemination of this product is not authorized by the NCRIC. LE members can
        register at ncric.ca.gov and be added to the distribution list. Some of these
        events involve criminal activities such as planned looting, vandalism and
        threats of violence. </span></p><span style="font-family: Calibri, Times; orphans: 1;">
