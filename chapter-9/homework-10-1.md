# Homework 10-1: Install Spreadsheet Software

If you already have spreadsheet software you like, you're done. If not, here are some options:

- **LibreOffice Calc.** Download it [from here](https://www.libreoffice.org). It's free and open source and works in Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Microsoft Excel**. This is part of Microsoft Office. It costs money and works in Windows and macOS.
- **Apple Numbers**. This is free from the macOS App Store, and is only available on Macs.
- **Google Sheets**. This is Google's free spreadsheet software that's part of Google Docs. It's free and works in Windows, macOS, and Linux, however it requires you to upload your CSVs to the cloud before you can view them. For sensitive datasets, its better to use local spreadsheet software installed on your computer.
